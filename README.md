# ManufacturerManagerWithPlaywrightAndCICD

A pragmatic, testable, and pipeline-ready .NET solution designed for scalable manufacturer management — built with Blazor, powered by Playwright, and delivered through automated CI/CD.

Very much a work-in-progress as I add new functionality and tests.

## Actions currently failing following a Docker Image update. To be sorted ASAP ##

## All other code is good. ##
